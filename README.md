# Terraria Companion Mod
The Terraria Companion Mod allows you to connect to my Terraria Companion App (currently only available on Android) to sync your PC and Mobile, allowing you to use a variety of tools and information. This works in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

Let me know about any issues you have, I am a solo developer so it takes time to add new features, but I'll aim to keep improving this if there's enough demand.

## Features
This mod features many tools, such as an Item page and Recipe Browsing, Item Tracking and much more!

The youtube video above shows all the features in more depth, however screenshots and a showcase of a few of the features of the app can be found below:

## Instructions
1) Go to the TModLoader Workshop on Steam and install the Terraria Companion Mod, or manually install the latest release on this repo.
2) Install the Terraria Companion App from Google Play Store or find the latest version from the releases on https://github.com/FARH4D/Terraria-Companion-App
3) a) Launch Terraria and enable the Companion Mod, if you enter a world and go into the mod settings for the companion mod, you'll be able to see your PC's ip and the port to use on the app.

   b) The ip in the mod settings may be incorrect in some cases, if it's incorrect then open 'cmd' and type in 'ipconfig'. Look under the section that corresponds to your active network adapter (e.g. 'Wi-Fi' or 'Ethernet') and use the ip shown after `IPv4 Address`
4) Launch the Companion App and type in the correct ip and port, make sure your mobile and PC are on the same Wi-Fi network.
5) Enjoy and let me know about any issues
