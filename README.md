# Terraria Companion Mod
The Terraria Companion Mod allows you to connect to my Terraria Companion App (currently only available on Android) to sync your PC and Mobile, allowing you to use a variety of tools and information. This works in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

Let me know about any issues you have, I am a solo developer so it takes time to add new features, but I'll aim to keep improving this if there's enough demand.

## Showcase
Using the Terraria Companion Mod gives you a wide variety of tools, some of which are shown below.

![Companion App Home Page](https://github.com/FARH4D/TerrariaCompanionMod/blob/main/Showcase/appPreview1.png?raw=true)
The Home page shows you a live display of your character, alongside your current hp, mana and any potion loadouts that you've created.

![Companion App Item Page](https://github.com/FARH4D/TerrariaCompanionMod/blob/main/Showcase/appPreview2.png?raw=true)
On the Item page you can see a list of every item in the game, modded or vanilla, you may search for them but also use one of the many categories to easily find what you're looking for.

If you click on an item, you can access a separate page with deeper information about it, such as the recipes to make the item. Double click any item in the recipe and you'll be able to access that item's page too.
(In the future I will add item stats and figure out a way to add a list of enemies that drop the item)

![Companion App Beastiary](https://github.com/FARH4D/TerrariaCompanionMod/blob/main/Showcase/appPreview4.png?raw=true)
A Beastiary is also in this app, allowing you to see a list of every NPC in the game, alongside what they drop and their drop rates, fully adjusted to your world.

These are only some of the features of this mod, there is also a Boss Checklist and a Potion Loadout creator.

## Instructions
1) Go to the TModLoader Workshop on Steam and install the Terraria Companion Mod, or manually install the latest release on this repo.
2) Install the Terraria Companion App from Google Play Store or find the latest version from the releases on https://github.com/FARH4D/Terraria-Companion-App
3) a) Launch Terraria and enable the Companion Mod, if you enter a world and go into the mod settings for the companion mod, you'll be able to see your PC's ip and the port to use on the app.
   b) The ip in the mod settings may be incorrect in some cases, if it's incorrect then open 'cmd' and type in 'ipconfig'. Look under the section that corresponds to your active network adapter (e.g. 'Wi-Fi' or 'Ethernet') and use the ip shown after `IPv4 Address`
4) Launch the Companion App and type in the correct ip and port, make sure your mobile and PC are on the same Wi-Fi network.
5) Enjoy and let me know about any issues
