# Features

Using the Terraria Companion Mod gives you a wide variety of tools, some of which are shown below.

![Companion App Home Page](https://github.com/FARH4D/TerrariaCompanionMod/blob/main/Showcase/appPreview1.png?raw=true)

The Home page shows you a live display of your character, alongside your current hp, mana and any potion loadouts that you've created.

![Companion App Item Page](https://github.com/FARH4D/TerrariaCompanionMod/blob/main/Showcase/appPreview2.png?raw=true)

On the Item page you can see a list of every item in the game, modded or vanilla, you may search for them but also use one of the many categories to easily find what you're looking for.

If you click on an item, you can access a separate page with deeper information about it, such as the recipes to make the item. Double click any item in the recipe and you'll be able to access that item's page too.
(In the future I will add item stats and figure out a way to add a list of enemies that drop the item)

![Companion App Beastiary](https://github.com/FARH4D/TerrariaCompanionMod/blob/main/Showcase/appPreview4.png?raw=true)

A Beastiary is also in this app, allowing you to see a list of every NPC in the game, alongside what they drop and their drop rates, fully adjusted to your world.

These are only some of the features of this mod, there is also a Boss Checklist and a Potion Loadout creator, and Item Tracking.
