The Terraria Companion Mod allows you to connect to my Terraria Companion App (currently only available on Android) to sync your PC and Mobile, allowing you to use a variety of tools and information. This works in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

This mod features many tools, such as an Item page and Recipe Browsing, Item Tracking, a Beastiary, Boss Checklist and much more!

Find a more in-depth explanation on how to use this mod on the Steam Workshop page or the Github repo: https://github.com/FARH4D/Terraria-Companion-App

For full functionality please ensure you have the Boss Checklist mod from JavidPack installed.

Initial loading times when launching Terraria and entering a world may be a bit slower, because the mod needs to index all the items and NPCs, so please be patient while this happens.
